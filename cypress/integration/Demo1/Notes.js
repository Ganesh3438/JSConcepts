// 1. What is OOPs?
// Object oriented programming system. it aims to implement real world scenarios like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc...

// 2. What is Objects?
// Objects means simply real word entities such as mobile, laptop, bike , car , cat etc...
// Objects have attributes/properties and actions/behaviour.

// 3. What is class?
// Class is blue print for creating objects.
// We can create any number of objects with the same properties and actions by using classes.
// Example: one car class is created, then we can create any number of cars with any name like Tesla, Audi, BMW with different features.

// 4. Encapsulation:
// Encapsulation is a functionality to hide the data in a single unit alone with a functionality to protect the information from outside
// Data of Object should not be directly exposed

// use var keyword to make data members private.
// use setter methods to set the data and getter methods to get the data.

// Example: The best example of encapsulation could be a calculator. We know that we can press 2 + 2 = and see the results on display. 
// We don't care about the internal parts like chips, electrical things how they are implemented etc...

// 5. Inheritance  is a mechanism where you can derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes
// and methods.
